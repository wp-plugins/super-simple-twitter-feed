== Description ==

Gets your latest tweet. This plugin uses Twitter API (V1.1). It uses cURL which needs to be enabled on your server or host environment.
We did our best to provide us with something we needed for our site - a simple single latest tweet that was very raw in format (text of 
the tweet and sometimes formatted HTML anchor tag or link). We thought others might find this useful too - so we decided to contribute 
it to the Wordpress plugin repository.

We also tried to keep the code concise and clean and in one file on purpose. We didn't think calling something "super simple" warranted 
PHP classes, include files and CSS and such. We just wanted the tweet!

We use this plugin @ http://www.betterweatherinc.com/seed
