== Description ==

Now gets your latest tweet OR tweets! This plugin uses Twitter API (V1.1). It also uses cURL which needs to be enabled 
on your server or host environment. We've updated the plugin from getting a single tweet and formatting only urls as 
links to allowing you to choose how many tweets you want, how to format them, AND formatting hash tags "#" and "@" text 
as links. ALL of which is configurable by you! In keeping with the "Simple" theme, these choices are easy to make in the 
settings of the plugin.

We've also kept the code concise and clean and in one file on purpose.
